        I am a former preschool teaching assistant who discovered a passion for
        programming after working as a content specialist at a tech start up.
        After taking part-time programming classes while working, I decided to
        return to school full time. I recently completed a software engineering
        program and am eager to work as a software engineer where I will be able
        to combine both my technical skills and previous experiences to solve
        challenging problems.
